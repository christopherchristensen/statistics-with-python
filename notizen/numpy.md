# NumPy

Arrays of numbers are the fundamental data structure for data analysis.
Python's primitive values have a large overhead. This information is redundant
in lists, because the same type information is stored for every element. NumPy
arrays are much more efficent than Python's listsâ€•especially for big data sets.
Python also offers an array type without redundant type information. However,
this array type doesn't offer the fast and powerful operations of NumPy's
`ndarray` type.

Conventionally, the NumPy library is imported as follows:

```python
import numpy as np
```

## Array Creation

### Arrays of Python Lists

NumPy arrays can be created from Python lists:

```python
ints = np.array([2, 4, 6, 8]) # integer array
floats = np.array([2, 4, 6, 8.1]) # upcast to float because of 8.1
floats = np.array([2, 4, 6, 8], dtype='float') # with explicit type parameter
ints = np.array([1.1, 2.2, 3.3], dtype='int') # with explicit type parameter
```

NumPy arrays can be multi-dimensional:

```python
matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                   [4, 5, 6],
                   [7, 8, 9]])
```

### Arrays from Scratch

Numpy offers various functions to generate arrays from scratch. Where a
dimension is required (`dim`), a single number (length), a tuple of two (rows,
columns) or more (1st dimension, 2nd dimension, 3rd dimension, etc.) can be
passed.

- `np.zeros(dim, dtype)`: array of zeros
- `np.ones(dim, dtype)`: array of ones
- `np.full(dim, value)`: array filled with the given value
- `np.arange(start, end, step)`: array with values from start (inclusive) to
  end (exclusive) and given step width; `length=(end-start)/step`
- `np.linspace(from, to, n)`: array with evenly spaced values in interval
  `[from,to]` (both inclusive) of length n
- `np.random.random(dim)`: uniformly distributed random values
- `np.random.noraml(mean, sd, dim)`: normally distributed array with the given
  mean and standard deviation
- `np.random.randint(from, to, dim)`: random integers in the interval
  `[from,to)` (inclusive/exclusive)
- `np.eye(n)`: identity matrix with n rows and columns (values at indices with
  equal row/column index are 1)
- `np.empty(dim)`: uninitialized array, values from current memory content
  (garbage)

### Data Types

The `dtype` parameter can either be passed as a string literal or using a
pre-defined constant:

1. literal: `dtype='int32'`
2. constant: `dtype=np.int32`

Common numeric types are:

- boolean: `Bool_`
- signed integers: `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`
    - `int_`: system's default `long`
    - `intc`: system's default `int`
- unsigned integers: `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64`
- floating point: `float16`, `float32`, `float64` 
    - `float_`: system default
- complex numbers: `complex64`, `complex128`
    - `complex_`: system default
