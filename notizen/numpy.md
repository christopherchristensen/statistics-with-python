# NumPy

Arrays of numbers are the fundamental data structure for data analysis.
Python's primitive values have a large overhead. This information is redundant
in lists, because the same type information is stored for every element. NumPy
arrays are much more efficent than Python's listsâ€•especially for big data sets.
Python also offers an array type without redundant type information. However,
this array type doesn't offer the fast and powerful operations of NumPy's
`ndarray` type.

Conventionally, the NumPy library is imported as follows:

```python
import numpy as np
```

## Array Creation

NumPy arrays can be created from Python lists:

```python
ints = np.array([2, 4, 6, 8]) # integer array
floats = np.array([2, 4, 6, 8.1]) # upcast to float because of 8.1
floats = np.array([2, 4, 6, 8], dtype='float') # with explicit type parameter
ints = np.array([1.1, 2.2, 3.3], dtype='int') # with explicit type parameter
```

NumPy arrays can be multi-dimensional:

```python
matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                   [4, 5, 6],
                   [7, 8, 9]])
```
