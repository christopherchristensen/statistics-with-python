# Pandas

Pandas is a package built on top of NumPy, which offers powerful data
operations familiar to those of data bases and spreadsheets. The fundamental
data structures of Pandas are `Series`, `DataFrame` and `Index`. A `DataFrame`
is a multidimensional array with labeled rows and columns, which supports
heterogeneous and missing dataâ€”an issue often to be faced with in real-world
data sets.

Pandas is idiomatically imported as `pd`:

```python
>>> import pandas as pd
```

## Series

What NumPy's `ndarray` is to Python's list, Pandas `Series` is to Python's
dictionary: a fast and very powerful alternative. Whereas Python's dictionary
maps a set of _arbitrary keys_ to  a set of _arbitrary values_, Pandas `Series`
maps a set of _typed keys_ to a set of _typed values_. A `Series` is made up of
two sequences:

1. `values`: a NumPy array (`np.ndarray`)
2. `index`: a Pandas Index (`pd.Index`)

### Creation

A Pandas `Series` can be created from scalars, lists and dictionaries.

If a `Series` is generated from list, the indices (first column) for the values
(second column) are made up automatically, i.e. sequentially:

```python
>>> pd.Series([1, 2, 3])
0    1
1    2
2    3
dtype: int64
```

An list of indices can be explicitly provided using the `index` parameter. The
the lists of values and indices need to have the same length:

```python
>>> pd.Series([1, 2, 3], index=['a', 'b', 'c'])
a    1
b    2
c    3
dtype: int64
```

However, indices can be noncontiguous and nonsequential:

```python
>>> pd.Series([1, 2, 3], index=['Foo', 'Bar', 'Qux'])
Foo    1
Bar    2
Qux    3
dtype: int64
```

If a scalar value is used instead of list of values, the same value will be
repeated for the length of the `index` list:

```python
>>> pd.Series(42, index=[1, 2, 3])
1    42
2    42
3    42
dtype: int64
```

A `Series` can be created based on a dictionary with keys to be used as
indices:

```python
>>> pd.Series({'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3})
a    1
b    2
c    3
dtype: int64
```

An additional list of indices can be provided to further select values from the
dictionary by their keys, and to specify the order of entries:

```python
>>> pd.Series({'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}, index=['c', 'a'])
c    3
a    1
dtype: int64
```

### Access

The elements of a `Series` can be accessed using indexing and slicing:

```python
>>> s = pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
>>> s[0]
1

>>> s[4]
5

>>> s[1:4]
1    2
2    3
3    4
dtype: int64
```

If arbitrary (noncontiguous, nonsequential) indices are used, slicing is
possible because of the fixed order of indices, but the upper bound is also
included:

```python
>>> payroll = pd.Series({'Dilbert': 120000, 'Wally': 80000, 'Alice': 110000})
>>> payroll['Dilbert':'Wally']
Dilbert  120000
Wally     80000
dtype: int64
```

## DataFrame

A Pandas `DataFrame` can be understood in terms of other data structures from
two perspectives:

1. As a generalization of a NumPy array of two dimensions, with row indices and
   column names being flexible.
    - NumPy arrays are indexed as `arr[row, column]`: row first, column second.
    - Pandas `DataFrame`s are indexed as `df[column][row]`: column first, row
      of the `Series` second.
2. As a specialization of a Python dictionary that maps a column name (key) to
   a `Series` of column data (value).

Generally speaking, a `DataFrame` is a sequence of `Series` sharing the index
value. Important attributes are:

- `columns`: returns an `Index` object (column names)
- `index`: returns the index labels (row names)

### Creation

A Pandas `DataFrame` can be created from `Series`, dictionaries and NumPy arrays.

If a single `Series` is provided, an optional column name for those values can
be defined in a list:

```python
>>> s = pd.Series([1, 2, 3])
>>> pd.DataFrme(s, columns=['values'])
   values
0       1
1       2
2       3
```

If a list of dictionaries is provided, each dictionary is mapped to a row.
Missing entries of heterogeneous dictionaries are filled up with `NaN` in the
resulting `DataFrame`:

```python
>>> pd.DataFrame([{'a': 1, 'b': 2}, {'a': 5, 'c': 4}])
   a    b    c
0  1  2.0  NaN
1  5  NaN  4.0
```

If a dictionary of `Series` is provided, each `Series` becomes a column with
its key mapped as the column name:

```python
>>> s1 = pd.Series([2, 4, 6, 8])
>>> s2 = pd.Series[(3, 6, 9, 12])
>>> pd.DataFrame({'two': s1, 'three': s2})
   two  three
0    2      3
1    4      6
2    6      9
3    8     12
```

If a two-dimensional NumPy array is provided, the numeric column and row
indices from the array are used, but can be set using the optional `columns`
and `index` parameters:

```python
>>> arr = np.arange(1, 10).reshape(3, 3)
>>> pd.DataFrame(arr)
   0  1  2
0  1  2  3
1  4  5  6
2  7  8  9

>>> pd.DataFrame(arr, columns=['A', 'B', 'C'], index=[1, 2, 3])
   A  B  C
1  1  2  3
2  4  5  6
3  7  8  9
```

If a structured NumPy array is provided, the field names serve as column names:

```python
>>> employees = np.zeros(3, dtype=np.dtype([('name', 'S10'), ('wage', 'f8')]))
>>> employees['name'] = ['Dilbert', 'Wally', 'Alice']
>>> employees['wage'] = [120000.00, 80000.00, 110000.00]
>>> pd.DataFrame(employees)
         name      wage
0  b'Dilbert'  120000.0
1    b'Wally'   80000.0
2    b'Alice'  110000.0
```
