# Pandas

Pandas is a package built on top of NumPy, which offers powerful data
operations familiar to those of data bases and spreadsheets. The fundamental
data structures of Pandas are `Series`, `DataFrame` and `Index`. A `DataFrame`
is a multidimensional array with labeled rows and columns, which supports
heterogeneous and missing dataâ€”an issue often to be faced with in real-world
data sets.

Pandas is idiomatically imported as `pd`:

```python
>>> import pandas as pd
```

## Series

What NumPy's `ndarray` is to Python's list, Pandas `Series` is to Python's
dictionary: a fast and very powerful alternative. Whereas Python's dictionary
maps a set of _arbitrary keys_ to  a set of _arbitrary values_, Pandas `Series`
maps a set of _typed keys_ to a set of _typed values_. A `Series` is made up of
two sequences:

1. `values`: a NumPy array (`np.ndarray`)
2. `index`: a Pandas Index (`pd.Index`)

### Creation

A Pandas `Series` can be created from scalars, lists and dictionaries.

If a `Series` is generated from list, the indices (first column) for the values
(second column) are made up automatically, i.e. sequentially:

```python
>>> pd.Series([1, 2, 3])
0    1
1    2
2    3
dtype: int64
```

An list of indices can be explicitly provided using the `index` parameter. The
the lists of values and indices need to have the same length:

```python
>>> pd.Series([1, 2, 3], index=['a', 'b', 'c'])
a    1
b    2
c    3
dtype: int64
```

However, indices can be noncontiguous and nonsequential:

```python
>>> pd.Series([1, 2, 3], index=['Foo', 'Bar', 'Qux'])
Foo    1
Bar    2
Qux    3
dtype: int64
```

If a scalar value is used instead of list of values, the same value will be
repeated for the length of the `index` list:

```python
>>> pd.Series(42, index=[1, 2, 3])
1    42
2    42
3    42
dtype: int64
```

A `Series` can be created based on a dictionary with keys to be used as
indices:

```python
>>> pd.Series({'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3})
a    1
b    2
c    3
dtype: int64
```

An additional list of indices can be provided to further select values from the
dictionary by their keys, and to specify the order of entries:

```python
>>> pd.Series({'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}, index=['c', 'a'])
c    3
a    1
dtype: int64
```

### Access

The elements of a `Series` can be accessed using indexing and slicing:

```python
>>> s = pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
>>> s[0]
1

>>> s[4]
5

>>> s[1:4]
1    2
2    3
3    4
dtype: int64
```

If arbitrary (noncontiguous, nonsequential) indices are used, slicing is
possible because of the fixed order of indices, but the upper bound is also
included:

```python
>>> payroll = pd.Series({'Dilbert': 120000, 'Wally': 80000, 'Alice': 110000})
>>> payroll['Dilbert':'Wally']
Dilbert    120000
Wally     80000
dtype: int64
```
